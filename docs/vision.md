## Product Vision

Our mission is to develop an innovative application dedicated to making communities and cities more sustainable. Initially, the user will need to authenticate themselves in the application to access its features. Upon entering, the user will have the possibility to publish used furniture that they wish to donate. After publishing a furniture item, the user only has to wait for another user to be interested in the furniture and contact them. The transaction will be done in one of two options:

1. The two users meet at a predetermined location that can be arranged by a chat provided by the application.
2. The user offering the furniture will have access to a transportation service provided by the application that will take the furniture to the interested user's home. This service is paid.
